    "All modern high-level programming languages have some notion of [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)) applied to symbols that can appear in a program.  The scope of a program symbol defines the lifetime or visibility of that symbol. Program symbols that are subject to scoping rules include variable as well as function names and in object oriented languages it also includes type/class symbols among many other kind of symbols that can appear in a programming language.  Scoping of program symbols evolved in programming languages as programs became more complex and limiting the visibility of program symbols was necessary in order to avoid name clashes sources of bugs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Early dialects of Fortran and Basic only had global scope in that all program symbols where visible everywhere in a program.  Nowadays, almost all programming language implement static or lexical scoping where the scope of a program symbol can be determined by just looking at the program text.  This is in contrast with dynamic scoping where the scope of a program symbol is determined at runtime.  Here we only look at lexical scoping.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a symbol is no longer available or accessible then we say that it is *out of scope*.\n",
    "Consider function local symbols such as parameters variables.  These symbols are only available to the code of the function but are out of scope for all other code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest scope is the *block scope* characterized in C-like languages with the open and closed curly braces.  All declarations of program symbols within the curly braces are local to that block scope and become out of scope as soon the execution thread leaves that scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The languages we have defined so far only have global scope, that is, all symbols, in particular variable names, are visible everywhere. This allowed us to have variables defined by just using them.  Once we introduce scope we need a notion declaration to assert in which scope a symbol is visible.  Here we start with variable declarations and in later chapters we will introduce additional symbols such as function names subject to scoping rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting that Python takes a very different approach to scoping by assuming that all variables are function local unless they are declared explicitly as *global* variables.  In our approach we are going to be more traditional and allow the user to specify explicitly in which scope a variable is visible."

For example, in Microsoft's [Coding Style Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/stg/coding-style-conventions) all global variables have to start with the prefix `g_` and that prefix is forbidden for local variables therefore making it impossible for a local variable to shadow a global variable."

    "As the programming languages we are developing here are becoming more complex we can observe that different classes of errors can happen within a program.  Two such classes are *syntactic* and *semantic* errors. We can define these classes of errors as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Syntactic errors are errors that occur in the structure of a program such as a missing semicolon or a misspelled keyword.\n",

    "* Semantic errors are errors in the behavior of a program such as using a variable before it was declared.\n",

That is the parser cannot detect these errors and we have to rely on other ways of detecting these errors.  In the case of Cuppa2 we used the symbol table to enforce some of the semantics or behavior rules of the language with regards to variable declarations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of a semantic error  is the [division by zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero) error.  It is a semantic error because in general it is not detectable by an interpreter or compiler at a parse time. In most programming languages a division by zero results in the termination of the program with an error.  An interpreter will detect this kind of error while executing a program.  However, what sets this error apart from for example, an undeclared variable error, is the fact that a compiler cannot detect this semantic error.  This kind of semantic error is due to a faulty calculation in the algorithm a program implements and since a compiler does not perform any computation but simply translates a program into a target language this faulty behavior is passed along to the translated program which will then terminate when this error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another classic example of a semantic error is the [`null` pointer dereference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer) in C.  In C it is illegal to dereference a pointer variable whose value is 0 or `null`.  Doing so will result in a \"crash\" of the program.  However, it is impossible for a C compiler to flag such a dereference at compile time because it is usally the result of a mistake in the algorithm a program implements.  Since a compiler does not perform any computations but simply translates a source program it cannot detect these kinds of errors and again the faulty behavior is passed along to the translated program which will then \"crash\" when this error occurs.  \n",

    "Every modern programming language has some notion of scope in order to limit the visibility of symbols within programs.  Here we designed our Cuppa2 language by extending the Cuppa1 language with the `declare` statement allowing us declare variables in specific scopes and by allowing block statements to introduce new scope levels.  In order to support scoping properly we added functionality to our symbol table mechanism in the form of a stack of dictionaries.  As we saw, this works very well since nested scopes can be modeled nicely via a stack.  We built  a Cuppa2 interpreter and a compiler both loosely based on their Cuppa1 equivalents.  It was interesting to observe that we only had to modify the code directly affected by the language design change.  In addition we had to address specific challenges when compiling scoped code since in most cases the target language does not support any kind of scoping."
