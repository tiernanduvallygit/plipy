    "In this chapter we continue our discussion of IR design.  We introduce the idea of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) as an IR which is well suited for more complex languages.  We show that this intermediate representation can be directly derived from the grammar itself which facilitates the IR design. We illustrate these ideas with an interpreter that interprets our first high level language called Cuppa1.  This example also illustrates a very elegant way of processessing abstract syntax trees via something called *tree walking*.  We finish the chapter by designing a tree walker for a pretty printer with twist for our Cuppa1 language."

Without the precedence and associativity information an LR parser would parse this as `3 * (4 + 1)` which is of course not correct knowing that multiplication has a higher precednce than addition.  If we inform the parser of the precedence and associativity of the various operators then an LR parser will parse this correctly as `(3 * 4) + 1`.  \n",

    "We started the chapter with a discussion of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) as an IR which is well suited for more complex languages. We show that this intermediate representation can be directly derived from the grammar or more precisely from the parse trees a grammar generates.  We used these ideas to construct an interpreter for our first high-level language Cuppa1.  We used tree walking as a technique to interpret the AST generated by the frontend.  The frontend is the part of a language processor that generates the AST and usually fills out the symbol table with some basic information about the symbols/variables it encounters while processing the input program.  We looked at the architecture of tree walkers in some detail.  These usually reflect the recursive nature of the ASTs.  The basic components of a tree walker is a dispatcher and a set of node functions; one for each type of node that can appear in the AST.   We finished the chapter by designing a tree walker for a pretty printer with twist for our Cuppa1 language.  This pretty printer flagged unused but defined variables in the generated output program."
