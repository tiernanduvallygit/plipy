Because of its simplicity it is a widely used technique and, as a matter of fact, it is the only argument value transmission technique used both in C and Java.\n",

    "In passing arguments by reference, the memory address or reference of the actual argument is computed before the called function executes.  Inside the called function, that memory address is used as the memory address of the corresponding formal arguemnt.  In effect, the formal argument is now an alias for the actual argument.  That is, the formal argument accesses the same memory location as the actual argument.  This type of argument passing is very efficient for large objects because it avoids having to copy a large amount of memory into a function in order to initialize a formal argument as would be the case for a by value call. By reference calling is used in Fortran and is also available in C++."
