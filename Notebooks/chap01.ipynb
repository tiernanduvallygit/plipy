If the IR of the program conforms to the semantic specification of the programming language then the module produces an annotated version of the IR.  The annotation of the IR might include such things as the type and size of declared variables and wether or not a function call references a function defined in the current program file or if it is a call to an externally defined function.  These and many  other kinds of annotations are possible and are typically included in the annotated IR. The semantic module essentially attaches information to the validated IR of the program that will make later processing such as code generation easier.\n",
