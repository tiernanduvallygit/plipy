    "There has been a noticable shift in the approach of implementing programming languages over the past 15 or so years.\n",
    "Before the introduction of Java in the mid 1990's the only \"legitimate\" way to implement a programming language was to construct a compiler that compiled programs written in a high-level source language into target machine code.  The success of Java and its virtual machine approach legitimized alternative approaches to language implementation.  Since then many successful, modern programming languages such as Perl, Ruby, Python (to name but a few) have been implemented using alternative approaches. Implementation approaches explored by these languages include incremental interpreters, virtual machines, as well as just-in-time compilers.  It is interesting to observe that this shift is not reflected in many of the available text books.  The majority of text books still view the 'compiler to machine code' as the primary programming language implementation paradigm and therefore ignore the implementation strategies of the majority of modern programming languages that are in use today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thread we can follow is the rise of the idea of domain specific languages (Fowler, 2010).  A domain specific language is a language that has been designed to solve problems in a specific domain.  This is in contrast to\n",
    "general purpose languages such as Java or C++.   It is now generally accepted that developing domain specific programming languages is a legitimate part of a software engineering approach to developing a software solution.\n",
    "Domain specific languages are only rarely implemented using a full blown compiler.  In most cases some sort of interpretation or virtual machine approach is used to implement these languages.  Observe that this important development in programming languages is pretty much ignored by the majority of current text books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since many current books on programming language implementation only address the \"compile to machine code\" approach to language implementation it makes seem programming language implementation to be an extremely complicated task, *e.g.* (Cooper & Torczon, 2011).  Which is of course true if you are looking at a high-performance compiler, but it is not true if you look at the implementation of smaller languages designed to handle specific tasks.  By making the topic as complex as these books do (*e.g.* the book cited above spends 200+ pages on parsing theory alone!), these books deny students access to an interesting, straight-forward way of solving software engineering problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book you are looking at addresses the points raised above.  We take a pragmatic point of view of programming\n",
    "language implementation with the goal of having the reader implement programming languages \"from day one\". We look at interpretation, virtual machines, and compilers using small, realistic languages.  One of the strengths of the  \"implement from day one\" approach is that we start with very simple languages and then build on the acquired expertise incrementally until we show how languages with functions and type systems can be interpreted and/or compiled.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that Python is the perfect environment for the exploration of programming languages with its abilitiy to load and run modules independently from one another.  This allows us to incrementally explore different aspects of programming language implementation. The material in the book is accessible to anyone who has taken a college-level programming course or has equivalent experience.  We also expect that the reader has some exposure to Python programming.  Once the reader has mastered the material in the book he or she will be appropriately prepared to master advanced topics such as high-performance compilers and advanced architectures.\n",
